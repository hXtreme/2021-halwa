# Halwa

[![Tests](https://github.com/hXtreme/2021-halwa/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hXtreme/2021-halwa/actions/workflows/haskell.yml)

A basic datalog engine made in Haskell.

## Module organization

Haskell packages typically divide their source code into three separate places:
  - The bulk of your code should be developed as a reusable library in modules in the `src` directory. We've created [Lib.hs](src/Lib.hs) for you to get started. You can add additional modules here.
  - The entry point for your executable is in [Main.hs](app/Main.hs). 
  - All of your test cases should be in [the test directory](test/Spec.hs).



## Building, running, and testing

This project compiles with `stack build`. 

You can add any needed library dependencies and update project metadata in [package.yaml](package.yaml). You should NOT edit the `.cabal` file. It is automatically generated by running Stack; see [this article](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/stack_yaml_vs_cabal_package_file/) for more information.

You can run the main executable with `stack run`.
You can run the tests with `stack test`. 

Lastly, you can start a REPL with `stack ghci`.
