A basic datalog engine made in Haskell.

## What is Datalog?

Datalog is a declarative programming language that allows users to write logic programs.

For example:

```
// Are two locations connected?

decl path(Symbol, Symbol).
decl edge(Symbol, Symbol).

path(A, B) :- edge(A, B).
path(A, C) :- path(B, C), edge(A, B).

edge("Towne", "Levine").
edge("Levine", "Moore").

query path.

// Result:
// path("Towne", "Levine").
// path("Levine", "Moore").
// path("Towne", "Moore").
```

## How to run?

To run a demo program you can run

```sh
stack run demo <demo-prog> <prog-args>
```

For example:
```sh
stack run demo evens 5
```

To run an external file

```sh
stack run <file-path>
```

## Module organization

Haskell packages typically divide their source code into three separate places:
  - The bulk of your code should be developed as a reusable library in modules in the `src` directory. We've created [Lib.hs](src/Lib.hs) for you to get started. You can add additional modules here.
  - The entry point for your executable is in [Main.hs](app/Main.hs). 
  - All of your test cases should be in [the test directory](test/Spec.hs).



## Building, running, and testing

This project compiles with `stack build`. 

You can add any needed library dependencies and update project metadata in [package.yaml](package.yaml). You should NOT edit the `.cabal` file. It is automatically generated by running Stack; see [this article](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/stack_yaml_vs_cabal_package_file/) for more information.

You can run the main executable with `stack run`.
You can run the tests with `stack test`. 

Lastly, you can start a REPL with `stack ghci`.
